### `POST /api/servers/:uuid/files/write`

Writes the given file content into a file in the server's volume. If the file does not exist, it is created instead. Unlike other panel and Wings endpoints, this endpoint takes a plain text body rather than a JSON string body, and should be used with the appropriate `Content-Type` header: "text/plain". No additional metadata is used by this endpoint, so if you want the file's MIME type and other attributes to be used, you should request the [upload file](./public.md#get-uploadfile) endpoint with the full file.

### Parameters

| Name | Visibility | Description                |
| ---- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| file | required   | The URL-encoded file path. |

| 400  | The file path is ignored, or the file path conflicts with an existing directory with the same name. |
